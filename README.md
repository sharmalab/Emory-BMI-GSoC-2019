# Emory BMI GSoC 2019

Welcome to GSoC 2019. We have applied as a GSoC organization, and we look forward to working with you this summer. 

# Communicating with the mentors

This year we will be using Slack as the primary medium of communication. Each idea on this page has a mentor assigned. You can find their email addresses on this page. Contact your mentor with the name of the project you are interested in, and they will invite you to our Slack team  (gsoc2019-bmi.slack.com). All communication will then happen on Slack. 

 
# List of Ideas
Discuss the project on Slack, and once you are ready to submit your application, use the template below. You must submit your application directly using the GSoC Program Site.


**[1] Interactive Multidimensional Visualizations**

**Mentor:** Ryan Birmingham ( rbirmin -at- emory.edu) and Nan Li (nan.li -at- emory.edu)

**Overview:** DataScope is a framework for exploratory analysis on high dimensional datasets, especially biomedical datasets. This project would involve creating interactive visualizations that would assist with cohort creation, manual dimensionality reduction, and dataset exploration.

**Requirements:** Javascript, D3 (recommended)



**[2] Machine Learning Model Support for Digital Pathology**

**Mentor:** Ryan Birmingham ( rbirmin -at- emory.edu) and  and Ping Gu (ping.gu -at- emory.edu)
